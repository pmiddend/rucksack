rucksack
========

This is just a short description for now, a larger one will follow.

What does it do?
----------------

rucksack does one "simple" thing: Reposition and resize rectangles relative to
one another. This is a fundamental task in creating GUIs (which consist of just
that: rectangles) as well as ingame user interfaces (think a HUD for example).

The library, however, is defined very generically. You define a tree of layout
"widgets" (a term borrowed from the GUI frameworks) and tell them to align
themselves. You can extract the resulting position and size from them.

Dependencies
------------

rucksack depends on [boost](http://boost.org) and [fcppt](http://fcppt.net). It
also integrates with [sge](http://github.com/freundlich/spacegameengine).
